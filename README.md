### Week 3 Group README Tasks
- [ ] a description of the problem domain your team is tentatively wanting to focus on in the project. 
(e.g., trivia, finance, real estate, etcâ€¦) -- Dorothy

##### Example: Adventure Game
- text-based game along the lines of Zork
- an appropriate API leveraged for some aspect of the game content
- templating system for creating new stories
- different types of items and collectibles
- inventory system

##### Project Domain
   a brief, high-level description of what kind of application your team is thinking of developing.
    Our team is considering developing a text-based, UofT themed (Life at UofT) adventure game. 
    With a graphical user interface (GUI), it will provide an immersive and interactive experience for the players. 
    This game will feature narratives with some illustrations to enrich the storytelling, and it will require 
    players to make choices (user input: click on possible options) that impact the course of the story. 
    We will leverage a language generation API to implement the core algorithms and generate dynamic narratives 
    within the text-based adventure game. It will help generate text responses based on player choices, manage 
    dialogues, and adapt the narrative to the player's decisions. 

    In addition to the core gameplay, the application will include various features to enhance the user experience and engagement. 
    These features include the ability to play with a friend, support for multiple languages (with a default option in English), 
    a ranking system or a game token might be given to players to assess their progress in the game. Overall, this application  
    aims to create an engaging text-based adventure game that offers both a captivating narrative and a
    user-friendly interface for players to enjoy.
